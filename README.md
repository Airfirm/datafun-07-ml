# datafun-07-ml

In this final module, I'll employ machine learning (ML). At a high-level, there are three general categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I'll employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions. Python makes it easy! 

In this project, I'll:

Build a model
Make predictions
Visualize the model
Publish your insights

# Steps

Step 1
- Created a new repo datafun-07-ml
- Cloned the remote project into vscode
- Added a .gitignore and requirements.txt files to add what couldn't be tracked in repo and also external packages to be installed respectively

Step 2
- Created a project virtual environment file process for references
- Created virtual environment
- Activate virtual environment
- Installed external dependencies
- Update README.md file
- Set VSCode Python Interpreter
